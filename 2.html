<p>Nice to meet you, where you bee<br>n?
I could show you incredible<br> things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin<br>
Saw you there and I thought<br>
Oh my God, look at that face<br>
You look like my next mistake<br>
Love's a game, wanna pl<br>ay? Ayy
New money, suit and tie<br>
I can read you like a maga<br>zine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly<br>
And I know you heard abo<br>ut me
So hey, let's be friends<br>
I'm dyin' to see how this one <br>ends
Grab your passport and my hand<br>
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
</p><br>
<p>So it's gonna be forever<br>
Or it's gonna go down in flames<br>
You can tell me when it's over<br>, mm
If the high was worth the pa<br>in
Got a long list of ex lover<br>s
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
'Cause you know I lov<br>e the players
And you love the game<br>
'Cause we're young and we'r<br>e reckless
We'll take this way too far<br>
It'll leave you brea<br>thless, mm
Or with a nasty scar<br>
Got a long list of ex lover<br>s
They'll tell you I'm insane
</p><br>
<p>But I've got a blank <br>space, baby
And I'll write your name<br>
Cherry lips, crystal skies<br>
I could show you incredibl<br>e things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies<br>
You're the king, baby,<br> I'm your queen
Find out what you want<br>
Be that girl for a month<br>
Wait, the worst is yet to come, o<br>h no
Screaming, crying, perfect sto<br>rms
I can make all the tables turn<br>
Rose garden filled with thorn<br>s
Keep you second guessin'<br> like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
</p><br>
<p>I get drunk on jealousy<br>
But you'll come back each time you leave<br>
'Cause darling, I'm a ni<br>ghtmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever<br>
Or it's gonna go down in flames<br>
You can tell me when it's over<br>, mm
If the high was worth the pa<br>in
Got a long list of ex lover<br>s
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
'Cause you know I lov<br>e the players
And you love the game<br>
'Cause we're young and we'r<br>e reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far<br>
It'll leave you brea<br>thless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
</p><br>
<p>Got a long list of ex lovers<br>
They'll tell you I'm insane (ins<br>ane)
But I've got a blank spa<br>ce, baby
And I'll write your name<br>
Boys only want love if it's torture<br>
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't wa<br>rn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture<br>
Don't say I didn't, say <br>I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever<br>
Or it's gonna go down in flames<br>
You can tell me when it's over<br> (over), mm
If the high was worth the pain
</p><br>
<p>Got a long list of ex lo<br>vers
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
'Cause you know I love<br> the players
And you love the game/<br>
'Cause we're young and we'r<br>e reckless (yeah)
We'll take this way too far<br>
It'll leave you brea<br>thless, mm
Or with a nasty scar<br>
Got a long list of ex lover<br>s
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
But I've got a blank space, <br>baby
</p>And I'll write your name
    </body>
