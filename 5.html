<p><stong>Lyrics</strong></p>
  <p>I would be complex<br>
  I would be cool<br>
  They'd say I played the field before<br>
  I found someone to commit to<br>
  And that would be okay<br>
  For me to do<br>
  Every conquest I had made<br>
  Would make me more of a boss to you<br>
  I'd be a fearless leader<br>
  I'd be an alpha type<br>
  When everyone believes ya<br>
  What's that like?<br>
</p>
  <p>I'm so sick of running<br>
  As fast as I can<br>
  Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br>
  If I was a man<br>
  And I'm so sick of them<br>
  Coming at me again<br>
  'Cause if I was a man<br>
  Then I'd be the man<br>
  I'd be the man<br>
  I'd be the man<br>
  They'd say I hustled<br>
  Put in the work<br>
  They wouldn't shake their heads<br>
  And question how much of this I deserve<br>
</p>
<p>  What I was wearing, if I was rude<br>
  Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves<br>
  And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play<br>
  I'd be just like Leo, in Saint-Tropez<br>
  I'm so sick of running<br>
  As fast as I can<br>
  Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br>
  If I was a man<br>
  And I'm so sick of them<br>
  Coming at me again<br>
  'Cause if I was a man<br>
  Then I'd be the man<br>
  I'd be the man<br>
  I'd be the man<br>
</p>
<p>  What's it like to brag about raking in dollars<br>
  And getting bitches and models?<br>
  And it's all good if you're bad<br>
  And it's okay if you're mad/<br>
  If I was out flashin' my dollas<br>
  I'd be a bitch, not a baller<br>
  They'd paint me out to be bad<br>
  So it's okay that I'm mad<br>
  I'm so sick of running<br>
  As fast as I can<br>
</p>
  <p>Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br>
  If I was a man (you know that)<br>
  And I'm so sick of them<br>
  Coming at me again (coming at me again)<br>
  'Cause if I was a man (if I was man)<br>
  Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)<br>
  I'm so sick of running<br>
  As fast as I can (as fast as I can)<br>
  Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br>
  If I was a man (hey)<br>
  And I'm so sick of them<br>
</p>
  <p>Coming at me again (coming at me again)<br>
  'Cause if I was a man (if I was man)<br>
  Then I'd be the man<br>
  I'd be the man<br>
  I'd be the man (oh)<br>
  I'd be the man (yeah)<br>
  <p>I'd be the man (I'd be the man)<br>
