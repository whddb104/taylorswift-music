<p>Vintage tee, brand new phone<br>
High heels on cobblestones<br>
When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
Sequin smile, black lipstick<br>
Sensual politics<br>
When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
</p>
<p>But I knew you<br>
Dancin' in your Levi's<br>
Drunk under a streetlight<br>
I, I knew you<br>
Hand under my sweatshirt<br>
Baby, kiss it better, right<br>
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan<br>
Under someone's bed<br>
You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
A friend to all is a friend to none<br>
Chase two girls, lose the one<br>
</p>
<p>When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
But I knew you<br>
Playin' hide-and-seek and<br>
Givin' me your weekends<br>
I, I knew you<br>
Your heartbeat on the High Line<br>
Once in twenty lifetimes, I<br>
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan<br>
Under someone's bed<br>
You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
To kiss in cars and downtown bars<br>
Was all we needed<br>
</p>
<p>You drew stars around my scars<br>
But now I'm bleedin'<br>
'Cause I knew you<br>
Steppin' on the last train<br>
Marked me like a bloodstain<br>
I, I knew you<br>
Tried to change the ending<br>
Peter losing Wendy<br>
I, I knew you<br>
Leavin' like a father<br>
Runnin' like water, I<br>
</p>
<p>And when you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss<br>
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs<br>
The smell of smoke would hang around this long<br>
'Cause I knew everything when I was young<br>
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time<br>
Chasing shadows in the grocery line<br>
</p>
<p>I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired<br>
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light<br>
And I knew you'd come back to me<br>
You'd come back to me<br>
And you'd come back to me<br>
And you'd come back<br>
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan<br>
Under someone's bed<br>
</p>You put me on and said I was your favorite
