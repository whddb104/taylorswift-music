<p>Loving him is like<br>
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street<br>
Faster than the wind<br>
Passionate as sin<br>
Ending so suddenly<br>
Loving him is like<br>
</p>
<p>Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall<br>
Like the colors in autumn, so bright<br>
Just before they lose it all<br>
Losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
Missing him was dark grey, all alone<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
Loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
</p>
<p>Touching him was like<br>
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you<br>
Memorizing him was as<br>
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song<br>
Fighting with him was like<br>
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer<br>
Regretting him was like<br>
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong<br>
Losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
Missing him was dark grey, all alone<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
Oh, red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
Burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
</p>
<p>Remembering him comes in flashbacks<br>
And echoes<br>
Tell myself it's time now<br>
Gotta let go<br>
But moving on from him is impossible<br>
When I still see it all in my head<br>
In burning red<br>
Burning it was red<br>
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
Missing him was dark grey, all alone<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
'Cause loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
Yeah, yeah, red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
Oh, burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
</p>
<p>And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
Comes back to me, burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
Yeah, yeah (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
His love was like<br>
</p>Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street<br>
